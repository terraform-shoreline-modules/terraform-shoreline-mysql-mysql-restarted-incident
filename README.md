### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# MySQL instance restart incident
---

This incident type refers to the restart of a MySQL instance that has caused an alert to trigger. It may be related to issues with the MySQL database or the server hosting the instance. The incident requires investigation and resolution to ensure the proper functioning of the affected services.

### Parameters
```shell
# Environment Variables

export SERVER_IP_ADDRESS="PLACEHOLDER"

export SERVICE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_MYSQL_LOG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export OLD_VALUE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_MYSQL_CONFIG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export MAX_CONNECTIONS="PLACEHOLDER" 
```

## Debug

### Check MySQL service status
```shell
systemctl status mysql
```

### Check MySQL logs for any errors
```shell
tail -n 100 /var/log/mysql/error.log
```

### Check the uptime of the server to see if there were any recent reboots
```shell
uptime
```

### Check if there are any resource constraints that could have caused the restart
```shell
top
```

### Check the MySQL configuration file for any issues
```shell
cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

### Check the system logs for any other errors or warnings
```shell
dmesg | tail -n 50
```

### Check the disk usage to see if there are any disk space issues
```shell
df -h
```

### Check the network connectivity to the server
```shell
ping ${SERVER_IP_ADDRESS}
```

### Check if there are any other services running on the same machine that could have caused the restart
```shell
ps aux | grep -i ${SERVICE_NAME}
```

## Repair

### Set the log file path
```shell
LOG_FILE=${PATH_TO_MYSQL_LOG_FILE}
```

### Check if the log file exists
```shell
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then

  echo "ERROR: Log file $LOG_FILE not found"

  exit 1

fi
```

### Search the log file for errors
```shell
ERRORS=$(grep -i "error" "$LOG_FILE")
```

### Check if there are any errors
```shell
if [ -n "$ERRORS" ]; then

  echo "ERRORS FOUND:"

  echo "$ERRORS"

else

  echo "No errors found in log file"

fi
```

### Review the configuration settings of the MySQL instance to ensure that they are not causing the restart.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the path to the MySQL configuration file

MYSQL_CONF=${PATH_TO_MYSQL_CONFIG_FILE}



# Check if the configuration file exists

if [ ! -f $MYSQL_CONF ]; then

    echo "Error: MySQL configuration file not found at $MYSQL_CONF"

    exit 1

fi



# Check the MySQL configuration for any settings that may cause the restart

if grep -q "max_connections" $MYSQL_CONF; then

    # If the max_connections setting is found, reduce it to prevent overloading the server

    sed -i 's/max_connections=${OLD_VALUE}/max_connections=${MAX_CONNECTIONS}/' $MYSQL_CONF

    echo "max_connections setting updated in MySQL configuration file."

fi



# Restart the MySQL instance to apply the new configuration

systemctl restart mysql



echo "MySQL instance has been restarted with updated configuration settings."
